		<h2>Preface</h2>
		<p>The human heart is a fascinating organ which you could say is the "heart" of the circulatory system. It is responsible for transporting blood throughout the body and consistently supplying blood with oxygen from the lungs. In order for an understanding of the circulatory system, an understanding of the heart, how it works, what it does, and all of the in between is an absolute must. The goal of this paper is to give a simple explanation of the heart to an audience with little prerequisite knowledge but without skipping out on important details. This subject might not be for the <i>faint of heart</i>. Please enjoy!</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>You probably have heard of the words <i>blood vessel</i>, <i>artery</i>, <i>veins</i>, but how do these all fit in with the heart? The heart is the central component of the <i>circulatory system</i>, an organ system in the human body responsible for <i>circulating</i> blood throughout the body, which supplies important resources like <i>oxygen</i>, <i>carbon dioxide</i>, <i>blood cells</i> etc. to various parts of the body. This paper will not go into the detail of how these other parts of the body use the resources given by blood, nor will it go into detail of what this blood carries, however it <i>will</i> explain <i>how</i> blood is transferred throughout the body; after all, that is what the circulatory sytem is for. In specific, we will be focusing on the heart, an organ in the body responsible for <i>pumping</i> blood to where it needs to be.</p>
		<h2>Blood Vessel Basics</h2>
		<p>Blood vessels are essentially the <i>pipes</i> of the circulatory system, and are the means by which blood flows through the body. The heart is responsible for <i>pumping</i> the blood through blood vessels or <i>pipes</i>, which then transport blood to the rest of the body, and eventually back to the heart to be redistributed and resupplied with resources. If you haven't already noticed, there is a lot of similarity between plumbing and the circulatory system, and in a sense, the circulatory system is just plumbing of the blood!</p>
		<p>There are three main types of blood vessels in the human body. There are <i>arteries</i>, <i>capillaries</i>, and <i>veins</i>. Let's distinguish some defining features of the three, and we can move on from there.</p>
		<h3>Arteries</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Arteries are the blood vessels which take blood <i>out</i> to different parts of the body from the heart.</i><p></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Veins</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Veins are the blood vessels which take blood <i>back</i> to the heart from different parts of the body. The closer veins are to the heart, the larger in diameter they become.<p></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Capillaries</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Capillaries are the blood vessels which connect arteries and veins. They are very small and thin, allowing nutrients from the blood to be absorbed by your body's cells through diffusion and <i>pinocytosis</i>, which is where cells actively retrieve the nutrients.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<p>This is a very brief overview of the types of blood vessels, but this base definition will serve us well for the time being. Now that we have some primitive tools in our toolbelt, it's time to continue!</p>
