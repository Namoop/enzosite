		<h2>Preface</h2>
		<p>The human heart is a fascinating organ which you could say is the "heart" of the circulatory system. It is responsible for transporting blood throughout the body. In order for an understanding of the circulatory system, an understanding of the heart, how it works, what it does, and all of the in between is an absolute must. The goal of this paper is to give a simple explanation of the heart to an audience with little prerequisite knowledge but without skipping out on important details. This subject might not be for the <i>faint of heart</i>. Please enjoy!</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>You probably have heard of the words <i>blood vessel</i>, <i>artery</i>, <i>veins</i>, but how do these all fit in with the heart? The heart is the central component of the <i>circulatory system</i>, an organ system in the human body responsible for <i>circulating</i> blood throughout the body, which supplies important resources like <i>oxygen</i>, <i>carbon dioxide</i>, <i>blood cells</i> etc. to various parts of the body. This paper will not go into the detail of how these other parts of the body use the resources given by blood, nor will it go into detail of what this blood carries, however it <i>will</i> explain <i>how</i> blood is transferred throughout the body; after all, that is what the circulatory system is for. In specific, we will be focusing on the heart, an organ in the body responsible for <i>pumping</i> blood to where it needs to be.</p>
		<h2>Blood Vessel Basics</h2>
		<p>Blood vessels are essentially the <i>pipes</i> of the circulatory system, and are the means by which blood flows through the body. The heart is responsible for <i>pumping</i> the blood through blood vessels or <i>pipes</i>, which then transport blood to the rest of the body, and eventually back to the heart to be redistributed and resupplied with resources. If you haven't already noticed, there is a lot of similarity between plumbing and the circulatory system, and in a sense, the circulatory system is just plumbing of the blood!</p>
		<p>There are three main types of blood vessels in the human body. There are <i>arteries</i>, <i>capillaries</i>, and <i>veins</i>. Let's distinguish some defining features of the three, and we can move on from there.</p>
		<h3>Arteries</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Arteries are the blood vessels which take blood <i>out</i> to different parts of the body from the heart.</i><p></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Veins</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Veins are the blood vessels which take blood <i>back</i> to the heart from different parts of the body. The closer veins are to the heart, the larger in diameter they become.<p></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Capillaries</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Capillaries are the blood vessels which connect arteries and veins. They are very small and thin, allowing nutrients from the blood to be absorbed by your body's cells through diffusion and <i>pinocytosis</i>, which is where cells actively retrieve the nutrients.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<p>This is a very brief overview of the types of blood vessels, but this base definition will serve us well for the time being. Now that we have some primitive tools in our tool belt, it's time to continue!</p>

		<h2>Heart Basics</h2>
		<p>The following diagram shows a basic representation of the heart with its major components labeled. Although it might look scary, it can be trivially broken down, so let's do that!</p>
		<br>

		<p>The human heart is divided into four <i>chambers</i> and two sides: <i>left</i> and <i>right</i>. (The left and right sides on the diagram seem reversed, but this is because the diagram is from our viewpoint.) These sides are separated by a tissue barrier, known as the heart's <i>septum</i>. On each side of the heart, there are two chambers, the top one being an atrium, and the bottom one being a ventrical. To specify which side an atrium or ventrical belongs to, it is preceded by its side's name, so to specify the ventrical on the left side of the heart, "left ventrical" is used. The heart's septum is also further divided into two parts; the upper part which divides the heart's atriums is labeled the <i>atrial/interatrial septum</i> and the bottom part which divides the heart's ventricles is labeled the <i>ventricular/interventricular septum</i>.<br><br>
			A heart valve is a structure which lets blood flow through one way but not the other. (The design of the valves and how they interact with each other to synchronize their opening and closing is very interesting, however it is out of the scope for this elementary paper.) There are four main valves as can be seen in the diagram. We can split these valves into two main groups: <i>atrioventricular</i> and <i>semilunar</i>. The atrioventricular valves are the valves between the atria (plural of atrium) and the ventricles; as you can see in the diagram, these are the <i>tricupsid</i> and <i>mitral</i> valves, and they move blood from the atria into the ventricles. The semilunar valves are the valves between the ventricles and the two arteries of the heart, the <i>pulmonary artery</i> and the <i>aorta</i>, and they move blood from the ventricles into the arteries. As can be seen in the diagram, they are namely called the <i>pulmonary valve</i> and the <i>aortic valve</i>.<br><br>
		At this point, I think an updated definition of arteries is in order. Although in the diagram only two arteries are shown, there are actually much more. This is because arteries branch out into smaller arteries. The pulmonary artery is responsible for taking deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation, and the aorta is responsible for taking blood to all other parts of the body that need it.<br><br>
		The aorta can be immediately separated into four sections, and each section determines a general area of the body where the blood will be taken to. A more detailed diagram of the aorta as well as the four section descriptions are as follows.</p>

		<h3>Aortic Arch</h3>
		<p>The aortic arch curves up and leads to arteries which transfer blood up the body to the head, neck, and arms.</p>
		<h3>Ascending Aorta</h3>
		<p>This is the first section on the path of the aorta and leads to the coronary arteries which supply the heart with blood.</p>
		<h3>Descending Abdominal Aorta</h3>

		<h3>Descending Thoracic Aorta</h3>
