		<h2>Preface</h2>
		<p>The human heart is a fascinating organ which you could say is the "heart" of the circulatory system. It is responsible for transporting blood throughout the body. In order for an understanding of the circulatory system, an understanding of the heart, how it works, what it does, and all of the in between is an absolute must. The goal of this paper is to give a simple and introductory explanation of the heart to an audience with little prerequisite knowledge. This subject might not be for the <i>faint of heart</i>. Please enjoy!</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>You probably have heard of the words <i>blood vessel</i>, <i>artery</i>, <i>veins</i>, etc., but how do these all fit in with the heart? The heart is the central component of the <i>circulatory system</i>, an organ system in the human body responsible for <i>circulating</i> blood throughout the body, which supplies important resources to the cells of various bodily tissues, and picks up various products (mostly waste products) from these tissues. This paper will not go into the detail of how these other parts of the body use the resources given by blood, nor will it go into detail of what exactly this blood carries and how, however it will explain how blood is transferred throughout the body and the significance of it; after all, that is what the circulatory system is for. In specific, we will be focusing on the heart, a muscular organ in the body responsible for <i>pumping</i> blood to where it needs to be via a network of <i>blood vessels</i>.</p>
		<h2>Blood Vessel Basics</h2>
		<p>Blood vessels are essentially the <i>pipes</i> of the circulatory system, and are the means by which blood flows through the body. The heart is responsible for <i>pumping</i> the blood through blood vessels, which then transport blood to the rest of the body, and eventually back to the heart to be redistributed. If you haven't already noticed, there is a lot of similarity between plumbing and the circulatory system, and in a sense, the circulatory system is just the plumbing of blood!</p>
		<p>There are three main types of blood vessels in the human body: <i>arteries</i>, <i>capillaries</i>, and <i>veins</i>. Let's distinguish some defining features of the three, and we can move on from there.</p>
		<h3>Arteries</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Arteries are the blood vessels which take blood <i>out</i> to different parts of the body from the heart.</i><p></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Veins</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Veins are the blood vessels which take blood <i>back</i> to the heart from different parts of the body.<p></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Capillaries</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Capillaries are the blood vessels which connect arteries and veins. They are very small and thin, allowing nutrients from the blood to be absorbed by your body's cells through diffusion and <i>pinocytosis</i>, which is where cells actively retrieve the nutrients.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<p>This is a very brief overview of the types of blood vessels, but this base definition will serve us well for the time being. Now that we have some primitive tools in our tool belt, it's time to continue!</p>

		<h2>Heart Basics</h2>
		<p>The following diagram shows a basic representation of the heart with its major components labeled. Although it might look scary, it can be trivially broken down, so let's do that!</p>

		<p>The human heart is divided into four <i>chambers</i> and two sides: <i>left</i> and <i>right</i>.  (The left and right sides on the diagram seem reversed, but this is because the diagram is from our viewpoint.) These sides are separated by a tissue barrier, known as the heart's <i>septum</i>. On each side of the heart, there are two chambers, the top one being an atrium, and the bottom one being a ventrical. To specify which side an atrium or ventrical belongs to, it is preceded by its side's name, so to specify the ventrical on the left side of the heart, "left ventrical" is used. The heart's septum is also further divided into two parts; the upper part which divides the heart's atriums is labeled the <i>atrial/interatrial septum</i> and the bottom part which divides the heart's ventricles is labeled the <i>ventricular/interventricular septum</i>.<br><br>
			A heart valve is a structure which lets blood flow through one way but not the other.  (The design of the valves that allow them to do this is out of the scope for this paper.) There are four main valves as can be seen in the diagram. We can split these valves into two main groups: <i>atrioventricular</i> and <i>semilunar</i>. The atrioventricular valves are the valves between the atria  (plural of atrium) and the ventricles; as you can see in the diagram, these are the <i>tricupsid</i> and <i>mitral</i> valves, and they move blood from the atria into the ventricles. The semilunar valves are the valves between the ventricles and the two arteries of the heart, the <i>pulmonary artery</i> and the <i>aorta</i>, and they move blood from the ventricles into the arteries. As can be seen in the diagram, they are namely called the <i>pulmonary valve</i> and the <i>aortic valve</i>.<br><br>
		At this point, I think an updated definition of the types blood vessels and how they work together is in order. Although in the heart diagram only two arteries (The aorta and the pulmonary artery.) and three veins (The pulmonary vein, the inferior vena cava, and the superior vena cava.) are shown, there are actually much more. This is because arteries branch out into smaller arteries which eventually lead to a specific tissue or organ, and veins start out small leading from those smaller arteries, eventually coming together into larger veins as they approach the heart. How do capillaries fit into all of this, well once some branch of arteries reaches its final destination, the resources carried by the blood cells need to be absorbed by the tissue cells and the blood cells need to pick up any waste (or in the case of the pulmonary arteries oxygen) produced by the tissue cells. As by the definition earlier, capillaries are the way to do this, but how? Well, a large network of capillaries is essentially in place between the artery and the vein, however there is a little more going on here. Let me introduce two new terms: <i>arteriole</i> and <i>venule</i>. These are blood vessels which can be thought of as the middle men between the capillaries and the artery and vein. The arteriole is a blood vessel which branches and distributes blood cells from the artery to the very small capillaries, and the venule is a blood vessel which joins the blood cells from the very small capillaries back into the main vein. A visualization of this is shown below.<br>

		The pulmonary artery is responsible for taking <i>deoxygenated</i> blood to the lungs for oxygenation, and the aorta is responsible for taking <i>oxygenated</i> blood to all other parts of the body that need it. An important conclusion can now be made. Blood flowing from the left side of the heart is oxygenated and travels through the aorta where it drops off its resources through a network of arteries carrying blood to all parts of the body. Blood flowing from the right side of the heart is deoxygenated and is sent through the pulmonary artery which sends the blood to the lungs to become oxygenated. The <i>pulmonary vein</i> is the vein responsible for sending the newly oxygenated blood from the lungs into the left ventricle where it is sent through the aorta. The <i>superior vena cava</i> is the vein responsible for carrying deoxygenated blood sent from the aorta to the upper half of the body to the right ventricle, and the <i>inferior vena cava</i> is the vein responsible for carrying deoxygenated blood sent from the aorta to the lower half of the body to the right ventricle. Once in the right ventricle, the deoxygenated blood is sent to the pulmonary artery to be oxygenated, repeating the cycle again and again.<br><br>
		
		The aorta can be immediately separated into four sections, each of which determines a general area of the body where the blood will be taken to. A more detailed diagram of the aorta as well as the four section descriptions are as follows.<br></p>

		<h3>Ascending Aorta</h3>
		<p>This is the first section on the path of the aorta and leads to the <i>left and right coronary arteries</i> which supply the heart muscle with blood.  (Yes! The heart needs blood to function like most other tissues and organs in the body.)</p>
		<h3>Aortic Arch</h3>
		<p>The aortic arch curves up and leads to arteries which transfer blood to the head, neck, and arms through the <i>left subclavian</i>, <i>left common carotid</i>, and <i>innominate/brachiocephalic</i> arteries.</p>
		<h3>Descending Thoracic Aorta</h3>
		<p>The descending thoracic aorta supplies blood to the <i>bronchial arteries</i>, a network of arteries supplying blood to the lungs.</p>
		<h3>Abdominal Aorta</h3>
		<p>The abdominal aorta starts at the diaphragm and leads to a vast majority of the body's arteries, one of its largest branches being the <i>common iliac arteries</i>.<br></p>
		
		<p><small>Note: Many relevant details like the different types of capillaries, the structure of certain blood vessels, how damaged vessels are dealt with (blood clotting), exactly what blood is composed of, etc., will not be gone into in this paper, however they are all very interesting topics and should be explored if curious.</small></p>

		<h2>Wait.. How does the heart pump blood exactly?</h2>
		<p>The atria and ventricles of the heart have seemed sort of useless so far, but they are the main ways your heart pumps blood. The atria and ventricles of the heart are hollow muscular chambers which are constantly contracting and relaxing to allow blood to flow through the heart. Blood flows into the atrium, which contracts, forcing the blood through an open valve into the ventricle which immediately closes after the ventricle fills to prevent backwards leakage. The ventricle contracts in a similar process, forcing blood through an open valve which leads to an artery. This process can easily be fitted to both sides of the heart with specific terminology inserted. Now, the missing link is what controls the consistent contraction and relaxation of the atria and ventricles? First, the atria are signaled to contract by the <i>sinoatrial node</i> (commonly abbreviated to SA node), a set of cells in the right atrium which produce an electrical signal that travels through the interatrial septum to the left atrium, in turn contracting both the left and right atrium simultaneously. The same electrical signal from the SA node gets sent to the <i>atrioventricular node</i> (commonly abbreviated to AV node), which slows the electrical signal to the ventricles for a short period to let the atria contract before the signal is sent through. The signal from the AV node contracts both ventricles. This consistent process of electrical impulses sent from the SA node and timed by the AV node allow for the heart to consistently move blood through its chambers out into arteries.</p>
