		<h2>Preface</h2>
		<p>The human heart is a fascinating organ which you could say is the "heart" of the circulatory system. It is responsible for transporting blood throughout the body and consistently supplying blood with oxygen from the lungs. In order for an understanding of the circulatory system, an understanding of the heart, how it works, what it does, and all of the in between is an absolute must. The goal of this paper is to give a simple explanation of the heart to an audience with little prerequisite knowledge but without skipping out on important details. This subject might not be for the <i>faint of heart</i>. Please enjoy!</p>
